Milkyway3d.org is a product of the Goodman Group at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, developed by graduate student Catherine Zucker and technical assistant Sarah Block under the advisement of Harvard Astronomy Professor Alyssa Goodman. The site was developed to facilitate the curation, visualization, and synthesization of almost two dozen datasets covering the Galactic plane, towards the goal of building a more complete, integrated 3D model of the Milky Way’s stars, gas, and dust. All of the surveys link to the Milky Way 3D Dataverse—editable by any member of the public—so please feel free to update existing Dataverses or create new ones as additional datasets and publications become available. If you would like your survey to be added to the WorldWide Telescope Galactic Plane Coverage Tool (or have any additional questions/comments about the site) please contact Catherine Zucker at catherine.zucker@cfa.harvard.edu or Sarah Block at sblock@cfa.harvard.edu.
